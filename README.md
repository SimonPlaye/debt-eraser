# Simulating the Erasure of France's Public Debt

## What Is This?

This website is a simple tool to simulate how three measures:

- a wealth tax on millionaires
- a one-time wealth levy on millionaires
- a reduction of government's public spending.

could help erase the public debt of France.

It has been coded as part of a project for the course "From Social Theory to Practice" at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

## How It Works?

The website is divided into several pages:

- The "Home" page which introduces the project and redirects to the other pages.
- The "Wealth Tax" page which simulates the impact of a wealth tax on millionaires.
- The "Wealth Levy" page which simulates the impact of a one-time wealth levy on millionaires.
- The "Spending Reduction" page which simulates the reduction of government's public spending.
- The "References" page which lists the sources used for the project.

The simulations pages allow users to input different values for the tax rates and spending reduction, and see how these changes would affect the public debt and deficit of France over time.
